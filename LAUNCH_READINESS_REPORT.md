## ⚠️ KNOWN LIMITATIONS (NOT BLOCKERS)

### 1. Payment Integration: NOT IMPLEMENTED
**Status**: Booking flow has "Payment" step but no actual gateway  
**Current Behavior**: 
- User can select "Online" or "On arrival"
- Booking is created with "pending" status
- No actual payment processing occurs

**Options**:
- **Option A**: Deploy as-is for testing (bookings are COD/manual payment)
- **Option B**: Integrate Razorpay (requires your API keys + 2-3 credits)
- **Option C**: Integrate Stripe (requires your API keys + 2-3 credits)

**Recommendation**: Launch without payment for initial testing. Add payment gateway before accepting real bookings.

---

### 2. Email Notifications: CONFIGURED BUT NOT TESTED
**Status**: Email sending code exists but SMTP not configured  
**What Works**: 
- Email templates for booking confirmations
- Email templates for welcome messages
- Email sending infrastructure in place

**What's Missing**:
- SMTP credentials (add to .env)
- Live email testing

**Impact**: Low - emails are nice-to-have, not required for core functionality

---

### 3. AI Trip Planner: UI READY, BACKEND NOT INTEGRATED
**Status**: Page exists, looks professional, but no actual AI  
**Current Behavior**: Form exists but doesn't generate real itineraries  

**To Activate**: Would require OpenAI/Anthropic API integration (not requested in scope)

---

## 🚀 READY FOR PUBLIC TESTING?

### YES ✅ - With Caveats

**What Users Can Do**:
1. ✅ Browse 12 Kashmir properties
2. ✅ View detailed property information
3. ✅ Register and create accounts
4. ✅ Login and maintain sessions
5. ✅ Select dates and create bookings
6. ✅ View booking history
7. ✅ Access traveler dashboard

**What Users CANNOT Do**:
1. ❌ Make actual payments online
2. ⚠️ Receive email confirmations (SMTP not configured)
3. ⚠️ Generate AI trip plans (AI not integrated)

**Recommended Launch Strategy**:
- ✅ Launch for **beta testing** and **user feedback**
